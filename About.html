            We think from the perspective of a mother of specially-abled. We should come together and help each other to bring up a child. 
            There are many questions and confusions in the mother's mind while bringing up a specially-abled child. We took the initiative to form this group for mothers of DMD. We are here to help you and guide you through.
            <br> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. It is a rare genetic condition that weakens a child's muscle and spreads loss of muscle mass throughout the body.
